# Library Management System

A library management system. This service will allow users to create an account or login. Upon logging in, users will be able to query the database with respect to genre,ratings, previous search preferences,alphabetically, and authors. The same can be done with movies. If the user logs in as a mangager they will have admin privilegios to make changes to the datbase & databse schema.

## Design Experience
The overall project was a success. We implemented various SQL queries , from basic to advanced queries that included aggregate functions and joins. The ER diagram proved to be an essential component of the design process as it set the foundation for the database and was a reference we can rely on and understand the bigger picture for. 3NF normalization of our tables allowed for much simpler tables and reduced the duplication of attributes within the database. The majority of our tables were in 3NF normalization already before applying Bernsteinâ€™s algorithm. This was a direct result of the dedication our group set to create a strong fundamental ER diagram. The Unix shell command line application allowed for quick access of the database system. The GUI allowed us to represent real life applications of our database system and see how RDMS create better organization of data and more efficient and easier code, when it comes to accessing data.
